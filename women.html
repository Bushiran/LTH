     <h2>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h2>
<p>Women's empowerment may be defined in several ways, including accepting
     women's viewpoints or making an effort to seek 
    them, raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, and training.Women’s 
    empowerment can also be defined as promoting women’s sense of self-worth, their ability to determine 
    their own choices, and their right to influence social change for themselves and others.

    It is closely aligned with female empowerment – a fundamental human right that’s also key to achieving a
     more peaceful, prosperous world.
    
    In Western countries, female empowerment is often associated with specific phases of the women’s rights
     movement in history. This movement tends to be split into three waves, the first beginning in the 19th and 
     early 20th century where suffrage was a key feature. The second wave of the 1960s included the sexual revolution 
     and the role of women in society. Third wave feminism is often seen as beginning in the 1990s.
    
    Women’s empowerment and promoting women’s rights have emerged as a part of a major global movement and is 
    continuing to break new ground in recent years. Days like International Women’s Empowerment Day are also gaining
     momentum.
    
    But despite a great deal of progress, women and girls continue to face discrimination and violence in every
     part of the world.</p></br>
