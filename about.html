    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Live Tech and Healthcare is a digital online (Web and Mobile App) platform for quality healthcare delivery and 
      maternal and child health services. With this platform, patients can book for medical consultations any time with
       qualified medical doctors and other healthcare specialists, have their laboratory results reviewed and their 
       prescribed medications delivered to them at the comfort of their homes.</p><br/>

     <p> It will also improve the efficient and quality maternal and child health services by sending periodic 
       reminders to pregnant women about how to spot danger signs in pregnancy, take their routine medications,
        when to visit ANC and their expected date of delivery.
      We will also raise awareness of women empowerment and individualâ€™s health by promoting responsible health 
      practices for the care of women and children. Women do not have many opportunities as men. For girls and women in 
      the developing countries like Ghana, inequality is amplified. Poverty is sexist, Live Tech and Healthcare is adding 
      its voice to the people calling for change. We will encourage the public to take control over their lives and
       improve their health and wellness by using available local resources.<p><br/>

     <p> We have realized that maternal and child health services have not been efficiently improved and most 
       people do not visit hospitals when sick due to long waiting periods at the hospitals, high hospitals 
       bills and bad attitude of some healthcare personals.
      This calls for an intervention that will allow patients and pregnant women have all their medical needs 
      attended to at the comfort of their homes. With an innovative technology, pregnant women and patients will
       received periodic notifications via email, SMS, automated phone calls about the status of their health.</p><br/>
      With our innovative technology, specialists will earn money, patients will save time, energy and money and pregnant women will have all the necessary and accurate information regarding their health, all information will be accurately tracked and recorded.
      Live Tech and healthcare deals with advance healthcare aims at offering a unique and seamless home, corporate and online health care services for pregnant women and newborns, and the general public. We believe that by connecting patients to competent, dedicated, well-trained and qualified medical professionals, who are responsive to the needs of our clients, their families and the community we serve, we will become the corporate, home, and online healthcare provider of choice in Ghana and beyond.
